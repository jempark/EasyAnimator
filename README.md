From the provider's code, we were able to get all of the features working successfully from what was working from their Assignment 7.

The features that were working was the play, resume, pause, restart, increasing/decreasing speed, and toggling loop buttons. Adding a shape properly added it to the Shape List, however, there were some issues with editing/deleting the keyframes and shapes. 

 We did ask them to fix a few things that weren't working such as loop, list of shapes not being displayed properly, animation window not scaled properly, and editing shape not working. They were able to fix everything but the editing shape/keyframe and deleting shape/keyframe, so these features do not work in our final submission.
